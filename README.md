KSP in Blender

This is all based around the python file ksparser.py, which operates on a given Kerbal Space Program .craft file
(the file type that ships are stored as)

HOW TO USE DEMO:

1. Download Blender from http://blender.org
2. Download .mu importer Blender addon from https://github.com/taniwha-qf/io\_object\_mu
3. Extract, put "io\_object\_mu\_master" folder (the whole folder) in Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.72\scripts\addons
4. Download kspblenderdemo.blend from this repository
5. Place .craft file into the same folder as the Blender file (they can be found under "saves" in the KSP.exe folder)
6. Follow these setup instructions: 

Change to Coding view
Change line 20, the KSP.exe directory, to your own directory (be sure to use double backward slashes!!!)
Change line 786, the craft name, to be the name of that file
Change back to Default view
Press Run Script in the bottom right
Wait patiently
Press Render (or F12)

7. Ask for help on reddit if these instructions suck
8. Render, then press F3 in the render window and save the image where you want it.
9. You can do tons more, but it will require learning some Blender. I'm happy to help with that.
